* neural-network

It has been proved from various points of view that the neural network
is a universal function approximator that can approximate arbitrary
nonlinear functions sufficiently well. We clarify the class of
functions that can be represented by the neural network based on the
integral representation (Ridgelet transform), and investigate the
relationship between the accuracy of approximation by finite sums and
the integral representation.
